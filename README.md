Welcome to the Docker Hands-on Guide! This project aims to help programmers like me understand Docker and provide a hands-on approach to learning how to use Docker for deploying applications efficiently. Whether you're new to Docker or looking to expand your skills, this guide will walk you through the fundamentals and into more advanced concepts and practices.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a powerful tool for developers and system administrators to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers allow you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development, ensuring that your application works seamlessly in any environment.

## Getting Started

Before diving into Docker, ensure your system meets the prerequisites and Docker is installed. Follow the official Docker documentation for detailed instructions on setting up Docker on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

To verify your Docker installation, run the following command:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a message indicating that your Docker installation is working correctly.

## Tutorial Overview

This hands-on guide will cover various aspects of Docker, including:

- **Docker Basics:** Understanding what Docker is, how it works, and the key concepts of containers and images.
- **Dockerfile:** Learn how to create a `Dockerfile` to automate the building of Docker images.
- **Docker Compose:** Simplify the management of multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
- **Deploying Applications:** Get hands-on experience deploying a simple web application using Docker.
- **Sharing Containers:** Learn how to share your Docker containers with colleagues or the Docker community using Docker Hub.

Each section contains step-by-step instructions and examples to help you get hands-on experience with Docker.

## Hands-on Exercises

This guide includes hands-on exercises to help solidify your understanding of Docker. You'll start by building a simple web application container and progressively move on to more complex scenarios, including multi-container applications.
